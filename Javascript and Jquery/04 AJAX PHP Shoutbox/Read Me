This application requires a server. I used local server using xampp. All these files should go into the htdocs folder in the xampp.
So depending on where you have installed xampp, go to xampp folder, open htdocs folder. Create a new folder (preferably jsshoutbox).
Copy all these files and folders to that folder.
